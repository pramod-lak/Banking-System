### NAME
E-CORP Bank Management System

### ABOUT
Welcome to the E-CORP Bank Management System written in Python. This command-line application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as account management, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and fund transfers.

### DESCRIPTION
E-CORP Bank Management System is written in Python and helps you manage your money. It runs in the command line, which means you type commands to use it. You can do important things like create a new bank account, put money into your account (depositing), take money out (withdrawing), check how much money you have (checking balances), and send money to someone else's account (transferring). The program makes sure your transactions are safe and checks that you have enough money before letting you take it out or send it. It's also a good way to learn how to use Python for basic programming. Try it!
